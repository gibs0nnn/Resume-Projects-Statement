Greetings to all who are reading this,

I hope you are doing well. Though I would like to publicly list the projects included on my resume, I
fear that the professors may still be using the same projects in current classes. To ensure my code does
not get into the hands of those who may claim it as their own, the repositories are all currently listed as
private. With that said, if you reach out and are interested in seeing the work, I would be more than happy
to send all of the code. Thank you for taking the time to review my work and I look forward to hearing from you.

Best Regards,
- Nate
